/** Provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
 * Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations which are chained together by a SlotAsyncReady.
 * To begin an asynchronous operation, provide a SlotAsyncReady to the asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered
 * when the operation has completed, and will be passed an AsyncResult instance filled with the details of the operation's success or
 * failure, the object the asynchronous function was started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous callback function is then
 * expected to call the corresponding "_finish()" function with the object the function was called for, and the AsyncResult instance.
 *
 * The purpose of the "_finish()" function is to take the generic result of type AsyncResult and return the specific result that the operation
 * in question yields (e.g. a FileEnumerator for an "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the operation is not needed,
 * there is no need to call the "_finish()" function and GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error information after the
 * SlotAsyncReady returns. You may also store the AsyncResult and call "_finish()" later.
 *
 * Example of a typical asynchronous operation flow:
 * @code
 * void _theoretical_frobnitz_async(const Glib::RefPtr<Theoretical>& t,
 *                                  const SlotAsyncReady& slot);
 *
 * gboolean _theoretical_frobnitz_finish(const Glib::RefPtr<Theoretical>& t,
 *                                       const Glib::RefPtr<AsyncResult>& result);
 *
 * static void
 * on_frobnitz_result(Glib::RefPtr<AsyncResult>& result)
 * {
 *
 *   Glib::RefPtr<Glib::Object> source_object = result->get_source_object();
 *   bool success = _theoretical_frobnitz_finish(source_object, res);
 *
 *   if (success)
 *     std::cout << "Hurray" << std::endl;
 *   else
 *     std::cout << "Uh oh!" << std::endl;
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * int main (int argc, void *argv[])
 * {
 *    ...
 *
 *    _theoretical_frobnitz_async (theoretical_data,
 *                                 sigc::ptr_fun(&on_frobnitz_result) );
 *
 *    ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The async function could also take an optional Glib::Cancellable object, allowing the calling function to cancel the asynchronous operation.
 *
 * The callback for an asynchronous operation is called only once, and is always called, even in the case of a cancelled operation.
 * On cancellation the result is a ERROR_CANCELLED error.
 *
 * Some ascynchronous operations are implemented using synchronous calls. These are run in a separate GThread, but otherwise they are sent
 * to the Main Event Loop and processed in an idle function. So, if you truly need asynchronous operations, make sure to initialize GThread.
