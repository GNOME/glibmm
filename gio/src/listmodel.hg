/** A dynamic list of objects.
 *
 * A ListModel represents a mutable list of
 * Glib::Objects. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets in
 * user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
 * convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
 * updates.
 *
 * Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
 * mechanism (normally the Glib::PropertyProxy<>::signal_changed() signal
 * of one or more of the object's properties). Taken together
 * with the signal_items_changed() signal, this provides for a list
 * that can change its membership, and in which the members can change
 * their individual properties.
 *
 * A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
 * points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
 * signal strength.
 *
 * It is important to note that the ListModel itself does not report
 * changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
 * membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
 * then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
 * interested in.
 *
 * All items in a ListModel are of (or derived from) the same type.
 * get_item_type() returns that type.  The type may be an
 * interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
 *
 * The semantics are close to that of an array:
 * get_n_items() returns the number of items in the list and
 * get_object() returns an item at a (0-based) position. In
 * order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
 * you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
 * get_object() until it returns nullptr.
 *
 * This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
 * thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
 * implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
 * the thread-default main context
 * in effect at the time that the model was created.
