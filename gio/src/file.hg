/** %File and directory handling.
 * %Gio::File is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a virtual file system. Gio::Files are lightweight, immutable objects that do no
 * I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that a %Gio::File object does not represent a file, merely a handle to a file. All file I/O is
 * implemented as streaming operations (see Gio::InputStream and Gio::OutputStream).
 *
 * A %Gio::File can be constructed from a path, URI, or a command line argument.
 *
 * You can move through the filesystem with %Gio::File handles with get_parent() to get a handle to the parent directory,
 * get_child() to get a handle to a child within a directory, and resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two Gio::Files.
 *
 * Many %Gio::File operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous
 * functions simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous I/O functions call a SlotAsyncReady callback slot which is
 * then used to finalize the operation, producing a AsyncResult which is then passed to the function's matching _finish() operation.
 *
 * Some %Gio::File operations do not have synchronous analogs, as they may take a very long time to finish, and blocking may leave an application
 * unusable. Notable cases include: mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file, unmount_mountable() to unmount a mountable file,
 * and eject_mountable() to eject a mountable file.
 *
 * One notable feature of Gio::Files are entity tags, or "etags" for short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file has been modified from the version on the file system.
 * See the HTTP 1.1 specification for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.
