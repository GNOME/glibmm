/** The Mount interface represents user-visible mounts.
 * Mount is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in quotes because it's not the same as a unix mount:
 * it might be a gvfs mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. It might or might not be related to a volume object.
 *
 * Unmounting a Mount instance is an asynchronous operation. For more information about asynchronous operations, see AsyncReady.
 * To unmount a Mount instance, first call unmount(). The callback slot will be called when the operation has resolved (either with success or failure),
 * and a AsyncReady structure will be passed to the callback. That callback should then call unmount_finish() with the AsyncReady data to see if the operation was completed successfully.
